# A nested for loop  is a for loop that is inside another for loop. The inner loop will iterate through its entire sequence for each iteration of the outer loop.

# rows = int(input('Enter the number of rows: '))
# columns = int(input('Enter the number of columns: '))
# symbol = (input('enter symbol: '))

# for row in range(rows):
#   for column in range(columns):
#     print(symbol, end=' ')
#   print()

# names = ['John', 'James', 'Paul']
# courses = ['Math', 'English', 'Biology']

# for name in names:
#   print(f"{name}'s schedule for:")
#   for course in courses:
#       print(f"  {course}")
#   print()
